Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

The savory smell. The crunchy bite. The salty kick. The buttery finish. Americans will recognize the smell and flavor of their favorite movie going snack anywhere. Why is it that we feast our taste buds on these crisp kernels while our eyes feast on the big screen? A few converging aspects made popcorn the quintessential movie snack, according to Andrew F. Smith, author of Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America. Mostly, it boiled down to the snack’s price, convenience, and timing. Popcorn was cheap for sellers and for customers, and making it didn’t require a ton of equipment. Popcorn also became popular at a time when movie theatres were in desperate need of an economic boost, which is how popcorn got introduced to the silver screen. Fun fact: popcorn does not refer to the popped kernel alone. It’s also the name for the specific type of corn that is used to make the snack. It was originally grown in Central America and became popular in the U.S. in the mid-1800s. Compared with other snacks at the time, it was super easy to make, and it got easier in 1885 when the mobile steam-powered popcorn maker was invented. What hit the streets in the late 19th century was a fleet of independent popcorn purveyors. They were like the great-great-grandfathers of food trucks.
